# Poker-Player-Marketing-Group-Forum
This is for help with re-writing the code for a Forum.

I created a Forum on Proboards.com

http://www.pokerplayermarketing.proboards.com

It is a Free to make your own Forum site. 

I made the forum with Categories and Sub-Categories for all sorts of Poker Related activities and qualifications. 
Once I created all the Categories and Sub-Categories i made a Google Docs Response Form to record the information on that they provide.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13-ZhkL7xkGDawM_RwgC7mqteAa6JbElvoDLZ6Wvs45c/viewform

The Response Form works perfect. And anytime someone submits the Form I am notified. 

**Problem**

The recorded information is stored on Google Docs Spread Sheet and I am not able to connect the Response's back to my Forum.

I want to alter the Code on the Forum to make a few things happen:

1) I really want the Form hosted on my Forum and not have to leave the Forum to do it.

2) When someone enters their information in the Response Form I want it to go to Google Docs Spread Sheet as backup.

3) I need ot be able in the code to alter it so that the Response's are linked to a Thread and post in that Thread.

4) I also need to be able to make it so that when they fill out the Response Form it makes a Profile Page that has all the categories and sub-categories listed.

5) The code has to be altered so that it automatically post in the appropiate listing.
